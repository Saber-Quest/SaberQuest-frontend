        <h1>How did you end up here?</h1>
        <p>Do you know that a 404 happens when you access a part of the site that simply just... <b>doesn't
                exist</b>?<br>
            Well, you just did that.<br>
            You accessed a part of the site that doesn't exist.<br>
            How? I have no clue.<br>
            You can head back to the site by click on <a href="/">this link</a> though, have a good day.
